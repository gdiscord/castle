Castle Core has been working with the GROW team in an advisory role for some time, through existing partnerships. GROW's goal is to use their own coin for airdrops and other promotions.  Some partnerships will consist of mutual airdrops from target communities, which will benefit GROW holders. The GROW software development will be covered by the Castle Core team, while the initial blockchain infrastructure (seed nodes, explorer, dev masternodes) will be the responsibility of the Grow team.  

From the GROW team:

"GROW coin is about helping communities organically grow, by co-marketing our brand. GROW coin is created as an crytocurrency for anyone who wants to invest in their future. GROW targets fast transactions with low fee. We want to make it much more accessible through crowdsourcing. GROW coin is created for people who believes in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal right and opportunity. 
Together we will grow!"

## Vote Calculation

The actual calculation is (YES votes - NO votes) > (Total Number of Masternodes / 10).

If there are 100 masternodes, the budget/proposal should need at least 10 YES votes without a NO vote.
